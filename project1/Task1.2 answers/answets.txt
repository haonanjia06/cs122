Q2.
expected_latency_h1_h4 = latency_L1 + latency_L2 + latency_L3 = 40m + 10ms + 30ms = 80ms
expected_throughput_h1_h4 = min(throughput_L1, throughput_L2, throughput_L3) = min(20, 40, 30) = 20Mbps

avergae RTT: 172.566ms
measured trhoughput: sent=53876 KB rate=21.493 Mbps

Explain: the prediction looks correct. 


Q3:
(1)For two pairs:
expected_latency = latency_L1 + latency_L2 + latency_L3 = 80ms
expected_throughput = min(throughput_L1, throughput_L2, throughput_L3)/2 = 10 Mbpps

use h1-h4 and h7-h8 to do the two pairs simulation:
h1-h4 average RTT = 163.021ms
h1-h4 throughput: sent=15024.0 KB rate=6.3247 Mbps
h7-h8 average RTT = 162.948ms
h7-h8 throughput: sent=46784.0 KB rate=19.1945 Mbps

Explain: the latency prediction looks correct. For the throughput, we can find that the second link takes the most bandwidth, rather than split it evenly with the other link. This may be caused by the traffic control strategy of the network.

(2)For thress pairs:
expected_latency = latency_L1 + latency_L2 + latency_L3 = 80ms
expected_throughput = min(throughput_L1, throughput_L2, throughput_L3)/3 = 6.67 Mbpps

use h1-h4, h7-h8, h9-h10 to measure:
h1-h4 average RTT = 161.943ms
h1-h4 throughput: sent=8632.0 KB rate=3.4258 Mbps
h7-h8 average RTT = 161.056ms
h7-h8 throughput: sent=12762.0 KB rate=5.0748 Mbps
h9-h10 average RTT = 163.039ms
h9-h10 throughput: sent=42519.0 KB rate=16.9986 Mbps
    
Explain: Like the two pairs simulation, the latency prediction looks correct. For the throughput, we can find that the last link takes the most bandwidth, rather than split it evenly with other links. This may be caused by the traffic control strategy of the network.

	
Q4:
h1-h4 go through L1, L2, L3
h5-h6 go through L4, L2, L5
The two paths share the L2 link

expected_latency_h1_h4 = latency_L1 + latency_L2 + latency_L3 = 80ms
expected_throughput_h1_h4 = min(throughput_L1, throughput_L2 / 2, throughput_L3) = 20Mbps

expected_latency_h5_h6 = latency_L4 + latency_L2 + latency_L5 = 20ms
expected_throughput_h5_h6 = min(throughput_L4, throughput_L2 / 2, throughput_L5) = 20Mbps

average RTT h1-h4: 162.341ms
measured throughput h1-h4: sent=48002.0 KB rate=19.22 Mbps

average RTT h1-h4: 42.536ms
measured throughput h1-h4: sent=63192.0 KB rate=25.0768 Mbps

Explain: The latency expedition is correct, and the thorough expedition is not. The two paths shares the L2 link, which has a BW of 40Mbps, more than other links. So, it may should be the bottleneck. For path1, the bottlenecl is L1, with BW at 20Mbps. And for path2, the bottleneck is L4 or L5, both with a BW of 25Mbps, which matches the measured result.
