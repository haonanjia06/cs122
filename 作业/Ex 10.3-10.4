The abstract method purchase is established in the Sale class, ensuring that child
classes will implement it. That way, each class can have a definition of purchase that
makes sense for it, as opposed to the computeTax method, which is implemented in
Sale and used by all child classes as is. A program that manages the sales transactions
as they occur could then conduct the transaction by making a polymorphic call to
purchase no matter what the transaction type is.

By defining the pay method in StaffMember, all child classes must implement it (or be
abstract themselves). So if pay were not defined in StaffMember, the child classes
would not have to implement it and the ability to pay all staff members through a
polymorphic reference would not exist. It is only by formally establishing that all children
of StaffMember have a pay method that makes it safe to pay them all.
